We have used Databricks for this project.

1. In Databricks first create a cluster 
2. Create a table and add the dataset in Databricks and copy the path given for the file. 
3. The dataset is a .txt file and the seperator is a space. 
4. Then create a notebook in the workspace and paste the code in the notebook.
5. Use the path of the table which was obtained while adding the dataset. Replace this copied path in the code instead of the path given in the code. 
In the code comments are given to change the path. Below is the part of the code
//change path of the dataset here below
val graph = GraphLoader.edgeListFile(sc, "/FileStore/tables/q801qdzx1478988957778/twitter_combined__1_-a997e.txt")
6. Run the code in data bricks, to get the strongly connected components along with their tightness.
